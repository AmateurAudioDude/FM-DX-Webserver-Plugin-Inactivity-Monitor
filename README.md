# Inactivity Monitor plugin for FM-DX Webserver

This plugin monitors for webpage user inactivity over a specified period of time before a popup asks the user if they are still there, once the timer has expired. If no response, the user is then automatically kicked from the server. _Timer is inactive when logged in as administrator._
